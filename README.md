# INCF-Impact-visualization-Portal

The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the field of neuroscience and neuroinformatics. They strive to establish and promote standards and best practices that are open, fair, and citable. INCF provides resources and support to neuroscience researchers, labs, and partners worldwide. Their work encompasses a wide range of projects, including predicting Alzheimer's onset, detecting cancer cells through image processing, mapping the brain in 3D, developing connectomes, and analyzing EEG data. Our proposed project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard showcasing INCF's impact on the global neuroscience and informatics community. The dashboard will highlight important metrics such as research progress and the number of lives impacted and saved.
