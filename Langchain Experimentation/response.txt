This project aims at developing a platform to make it easier for researchers to share and access
data, models and analysis tools in a way that preserves the integrity and traceability of the
research process, while ensuring the privacy and security of the data.
This is a continuation of the work done in the context of the NeuroInformatics platform (http://neuroinfor.com),
and will make use of the NeuroInformatics API (http://neuroinfor.com/api/v2), which provides a RESTful
interface to a growing collection of data, models and tools.
More details here.
Expected results: A set of classes , with demo Jupyter notebook, and unit tests in brief
